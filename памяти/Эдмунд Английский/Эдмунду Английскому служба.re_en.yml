вечерня:
   отпустительно:
      тропарь:
         глас: 4
         текст: In his suffernings the martyr king Edmund / exchanged an earthly
            crown for a heavenly one / and making glad in Thy strength, O Christ
            our God, / he overcame his tormentors and laid down the vanities of
            the demons. / Now let all the people of this land make gald with him /
            that through his prayers ours souls mаy be saved.
