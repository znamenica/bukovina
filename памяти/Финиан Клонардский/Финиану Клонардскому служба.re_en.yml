вечерня:
   отпустительно:
      тропарь:
         глас: 8
         текст: "Truly thou art the 'Tutor of the Saints of Ireland', O Founder of Clonard,
            great Father Finnian. As thou didst tirelessly teach the faith in thy native land,
            so teach us to follow thy example that many may come to know Christ and be led
            into the Way of Salvation."
