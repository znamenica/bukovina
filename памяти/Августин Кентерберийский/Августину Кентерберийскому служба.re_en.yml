         текст: Sent forth by thy master the great Gregory, thou hast marched with the holy
            cross and the image of the Saviour, baptizing the multitude with the clear
            waters of faith into the spiritual flock of Christ. As thou hast enlightened
            and hallowed the English land, sowing the seed of heaven in the earth of Kent,
            so do thou now enlighten and hallow us anew, O thou boast of Canterbury,
            holy Archpastor Augustine.
