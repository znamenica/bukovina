         текст: Being wounded by divine zeal, thou didst receive many wounds and endure
            multifarious tortures. With boldness having acquired the Kingdom of Heaven
            instead of the transitory crown of a queen, O thrice-holy Ketevan, intercede
            with Christ God to have mercy on our souls.
   молитва: Thou didst renounce the transitory glory uniting thyself with the Queen of
      Heaven and Earth, O Queen Ketevan, thou who didst suffer bodily for thy bridegroom,
      intercede with Him for us thy servants, the Georgian people.

         глас: 4
         текст: The Queen of Heaven, the daughter of David, immaculate Mary receiveth
            today the blessed Ketevan, the descendent of the seed of David, and giveth

            now standeth before the Holy Virgin interceding for us all.
