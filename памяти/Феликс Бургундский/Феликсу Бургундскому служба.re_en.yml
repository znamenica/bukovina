         текст: Felix of Burgundy, hierarch and teacher, preaching the Word of life,
            You did gather a rich harvest of believers; Together with Furzey of Ireland,
            pilgrim for the love of the Lord, Outstanding in virtue, renowned in word and
            deed; Enlighteners of East Anglia, we rightly praise you, holy and God-bearing
            fathers.

         глас: 2
         текст: Having come to the land of Sigerberht, the righteous king, You preached
            the kingdom of Christ our God, And as a first-fruit the king himself received
            the tonsure, Seeking an everlasting kingdom; And mindful of his monastic vow,
            He lay down his life, unarmed in the midst of battle; Wherefore, O Felix and
            Furzey, we venerate your memory crying out: Glory to Christ our King the
            Redeemer of the World.
