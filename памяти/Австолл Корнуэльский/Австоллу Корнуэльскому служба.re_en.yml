вечерня:
   отпустительно:
      тропарь:
         глас: 7
         текст: 'Light of Cornwall and pillar of the Faith, / holy Austol, disciple of Samson: /
            thou wast a fellow-labourer with Saint Mewan, / in such companionship that thou didst
            die with him and share his grave. / Pray to Christ our God to grant us His great mercy.'
