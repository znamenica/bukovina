         текст: Most glorious ascetic and chief of Ireland’s Prophets, O Father Brendan,
            thou wast a bright beacon in the western isle guiding many to salvation. /
            At thy heavenly birthday the Angels rejoiced and miraculously announced their
            joy to our Father Columba. / The prayers of the righteous avail much for us
            sinners. / Wherefore O Saint, pray to God for us that He will find us a place
            in the Mansions of the Blest.
