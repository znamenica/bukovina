вечерня:
   отпустительно:
      тропарь:
         глас: 8
         текст: Having been instructed and blessed by saints, O holy Father Ninian, /
            thou didst return to Northern Britain to preach Christ to thine own people. /
            Following thine example, O Apostle of the Picts, Light of those in the
            darkness of paganism, / True shepherd of the sheep, Teacher of the Orthodox
            Faith and Founder of Candida Casa, / pray that we will tirelessly labour for
            Christ among our fellow countrymen, that our souls may be saved.
