         текст: Noble Joseph took Thine immaculate Body down from the tree,/ wrapped It
            in a clean shroud and spices, / and having embalmed It, laid It in a new
            sepulcher. / But on the third day Thou didst rise, O Lord, / granting the
            world great mercy.

      кондак:
         глас: 2
         текст: 'Joseph of Arimathea took Thee, the Life of all, down from the Tree as
            one dead,/ and wrapped Thee in clean linen and spices./ He yearned to embrace
            and kiss Thy pure Body with heart and lips/ yet he restrained himself with
            fear. / He cried to Thee rejoicing: / Glory to Thy condescension, O Lover
            of Mankind.'
