вечерня:
   отпустительно:
      тропарь:
         глас: 8
         текст: Princely dignity was set at nought by thee, O Father Tysilio, / for thou
            didst put aside the glory of this world preferring to serve God in monastic
            poverty. / Wherefore we pray thee, intercede for us, that with courage we may
            renounce mammon // and live only in Christ for the salvation of men's souls.
