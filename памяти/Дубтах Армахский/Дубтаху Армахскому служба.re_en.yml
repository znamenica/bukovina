         текст: Compassionate pastor and inspired teacher of Armagh's flock, O Hierarch
            Dubtach, / thou art a model of piety for both the pastors and the laity of
            Christ's holy Church. / Intercede with Christ our God that we may be given
            grace to emulate thee // in bringing others to Him that we all may be saved.
