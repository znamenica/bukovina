вечерня:
   отпустительно:
      тропарь:
         глас: 4
         текст: 'O glorious Oswald, thou rule of faith and model of meekness, splendour
            of Worcester and luminary of York, like a tree in the midst of paradise Didst
            thou bear the fruit of the virtues for thy Lord, and therewith thou enlightenest
            all who cherish thine honoured memory and ever cry out to thee in prayer:
            Intercede, O holy bishop, that our souls may be saved.'
