вечерня:
   отпустительно:
      тропарь:
       - глас: 4
         текст: 'Thou didst love Christ all thy life, O blessed one, / and longing to work
            for Him as a hermit / thou didst struggle by the pools and carrs of Lindsey
            with good works, prayer and labour. / With penitent heart and great love for
            Christ / thou worked with missionary zeal for the Lord. / Wherefore we cry to
            thee: / beseech the Lord that our labours may be blessed and that our souls
            may be saved.'

         текст: 'Blessed one you loved Christ all your life, / and longing to work for Him
            as a hermit / you struggled by the pools and carrs of Lindsey with good works,
            prayer and labour. / With a penitent heart and great love for Christ / you
            worked with missionary zeal for the Lord. / Wherefore we cry to you: / beseech
            the Lord that our labours may be blessed and that our souls may be saved.'
