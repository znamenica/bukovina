вечерня:
   отпустительно:
      тропарь:
         глас: 5
         текст: 'Come, let us solemnly rejoice today, and let us laud the virtues and struggles
            of the most splendid luminary of the Western lands: Frideswide, great among ascetics,
            the most praiseworthy instructor of nuns, who watcheth over us from her dwelling-place
            on high; for the Lord hath truly made her wondrous among His saints. By her
            supplications may He save our souls.'
