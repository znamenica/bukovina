         текст: Having lighted the candle of faith in London, O glorious Martyr Aule,
            thy radiance was a challenge to the godless Diocletian who caused the flame
            of thy life to be extinguished. Pray, O martyr, that the flame of our faith
            may burn so brightly that through our constancy we may be found worthy of
            the mercy of Christ our God.

         текст: Thou didst sanctify our capital with thy blood, O Passion-Bearer Aule,
            defending the true Faith, which was more precious to thee than life itself.
            We honour thee, we hymn thee, and we praise thy name, rejoicing in thy
            glorious memory.
