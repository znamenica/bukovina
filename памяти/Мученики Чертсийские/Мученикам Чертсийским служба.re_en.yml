вечерня:
   отпустительно:
      тропарь:
         текст: O venerable martyrs of the Lord, mindful of the Sacred Scriptures, ye did
            not resist the rage of the heathen, but gave place unto their wrath; and
            blessing those who cursed you, ye bowed your necks beneath their swords,
            surrendering your souls into the hands of your Lord, Who alone is good and
            loveth mankind.
утреня:
   канон:
      кондак:
         глас: 2
         текст: Having fled from the din of this tumultuous world to the calm and quiet
            haven of the Abbey of Chertsey, ye strove tirelessly in ascetic stillness and
            bravely shed your lives’ blood for Christ, O venerable martyrs; wherefore, ye
            dwell now with the saints and angels on high.
