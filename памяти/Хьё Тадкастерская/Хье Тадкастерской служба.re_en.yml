         текст: In Tadcaster’s Monastery, O Abbess Hieu, thou didst shine with the virtues
            of asceticism and humility. Pray that we also may follow the example of thy
            great teacher, the Hierarch Aidan, and live lives of spiritual struggle that
            our souls may be saved.
