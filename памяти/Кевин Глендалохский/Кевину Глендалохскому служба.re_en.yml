       - глас: 8
         текст: Thou wast privileged to live in the age of saints, O Father Kevin, being
            baptized by one saint, taught by another, and buried by a third. Pray to God
            that he will raise up saints in our day to help, support, and guide us in the
            way of salvation.
       - глас: 4
         текст: With hymns of praise let us all bless the noble Kevin, who by his godly
            love poureth divine grace into the hearts of those who honor him; for he
            dwelleth now with the saints and angels in heaven, where he standeth before
            the throne of the Most High, praying unceasingly for us all.
утреня:
   канон:
      икос:
         текст: Ye lofty trees of Ireland, ever move your verdant branches, that with the
            rustling of your leafs, as with the strings of a multitude of harps, ye may
            make sweet music for the King of kings; for thus of old did ye delight His
            faithful servant, the venerable Kevin, with your melodious song, easing the
            severity of his ascetic life with the beauty of your hymnody, filling his
            soul with exultation, and causing him to cry aloud: Let every breath praise
            the Lord!
      кондак:
         глас: 5
         текст: Forsaking thy noble inheritance, and shunning all the crooked ways of this
            sin-loving world, thou didst apply thine obedient feet to the straight and
            narrow path of Christ, eagerly hastening throughout thy life toward the
            heavenly Sion, where with all the saints and the bodiless hosts thou criest
            aloud in ecstasy: Let every breath praise the Lord!
