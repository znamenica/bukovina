вечерня:
   отпустительно:
      тропарь:
         глас: 5
         текст: Drifting over the sea in a boat without oars / thou wast directed by God
            to the Island of Bute, O Hierarch Blane, / where thou didst devote thyself to
            apostolic labours. / O worker of miracles, / thou art worthy to be praised as
            Equal to the Apostles. / Wherefore we beseech thee pray to Christ our God /
            that He will raise up labourers to re-cultivate that northern part of His
            Vineyard, / so long overgrown with the darnel of heresy and apostasy, / which
            thou didst once tend with such care, / that again many may be lead into the
            way of salvation.
