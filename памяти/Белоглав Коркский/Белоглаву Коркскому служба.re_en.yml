вечерня:
   отпустительно:
      тропарь:
         глас: 4
         текст: Truly thou art hymned, O Hierarch Finbar,/ as a Father of monastics and
            shepherd of souls. / Seeing our plight and feeling for us in our great
            necessity, / cease not to intercede with Christ our God / that He will raise
            up in our days pastors of thy stature to lead us into the way of Truth.
