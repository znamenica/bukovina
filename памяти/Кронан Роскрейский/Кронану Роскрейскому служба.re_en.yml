вечерня:
   отпустительно:
      тропарь:
         глас: 1
         текст: O holy Cronan, in the monasteries that thou didst found / thou wast known
            for thy hospitality to the poor and to travellers. / Pray for us that we may
            follow thine example / and welcome all in Christ's Name, to His glory.
