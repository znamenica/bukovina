вечерня:
   отпустительно:
      тропарь:
         глас: 1
         текст: Thou didst bring many to the Faith, / erect numerous churches, extinguish
            the worship of false gods and cast down idols,/ O Hierarch Machar, establishing
            thy cathedral at Old Aberdeen. / As thou wast fearless and tireless in thy labours
            for Christ, / pray O Saint, that we may be given strength to follow in thy
            footsteps // and that thereby we may be found worthy of His abundant mercy.
