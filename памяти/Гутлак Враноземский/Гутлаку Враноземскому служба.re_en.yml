         текст: Father Guthlac you followed the ways of the prophet Elijah, / and
            the straight path of the Forerunner. / You became a dweller in the cisterns
            of Croyland / and in that wilderness brought forth fruit an hundredfold
            both conquering the demons and healing the sick. / Intercede with Christ
            our God that our souls may be saved.

      кондак:
         глас: 2
         текст: You abandoned royal estates and the life of a warrior to live by silence
            and prayer, / by this you inspired the English peoples, holy Father Guthlac. /
            Wherefore we acclaim you / as the father of English monasticism.
