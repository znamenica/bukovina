вечерня:
   отпустительно:
      тропарь:
         глас: 3
         текст: With faith, piety and devotion let us hasten to the sacred shrine of
            the wondrous martyr Alban, the first in Britain to shed his blood for Christ
            the Lord, for Whom he willingly laid down his life; and let us pray that
            through his supplications our souls may find mercy and salvation.
утреня:
   канон:
      кондак:
         глас: 2
         текст: Imbued with courage and bravery from on high, the glorious martyr Alban
            stood undaunted before the tyrant and boldly confessed Christ as the only God
            of all; and he utterly refused to offer sacrifice to false deities. Wherefore,
            having laid down his life for the Lord, he maketh earnest entreaty in behalf of
            our souls.
