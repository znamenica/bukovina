вечерня:
   отпустительно:
      тропарь:
         глас: 8
         текст: Giving thy life to Christ in monastic poverty, thou didst teach us a God-pleasing
            set of values, O Father Colman. / Wherefore intercede with Christ our God that He will
            instil in us constancy of faith, patience in trials and freedom from worldliness that
            we may be found worthy of His great mercy.
