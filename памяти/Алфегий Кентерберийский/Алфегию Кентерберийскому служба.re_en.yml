         текст: As thou didst willingly lay down thy life for thy flock, O glorious
            hieromartyr Ælphege, thine innocent blood crieth out to God like that of
            Abel and Zachariah; wherefore, standing now with boldness before the Most
            High, with them thou dost ever beseech Him to have mercy and save the souls
            of those who honor thy sacred memory with love.

   канон:
      кондак:
         глас: 2
         текст: Celebrating the sacred memorial of the holy Ælphege, who willingly shed
            his blood for Christ the Master, let us clap our hands in gladness, O ye Christians,
            ever mindful of his heavenly intercession; for, abiding in eternal glory, he prayeth
            continually before the throne of the Lord, that all who honor his memory with love
            may have their sins forgiven.
