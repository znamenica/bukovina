         текст: Righteous tutor of the children of Brychan, The Great Wonderworker.
            O wise Father Brannock, / thou didst win many souls for Christ by thy
            tireless endeavours. / In Devon's Braunton Church are your concealed
            precious relics./ Pray that we, being ever mindful of our Orthodox
            heritage,/ may never deviate from the true faith,/ thereby, receive the,
            reward of the blest.
